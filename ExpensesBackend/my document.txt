Dear Kannamma,

Words seem so inadequate to express the depth of my love for you, but I'll try anyway. As I sit here, thinking of you, my heart overflows with warmth and gratitude. From the moment we began this journey together, an indescribable feeling bloomed within me - a feeling that continues to grow, stronger each day. I don't know if it was this unwavering trust that made me say yes to your marriage proposal, but you've never once proven me wrong.You've always been my strongest support when I needed you most. You are always there for me , no matter what. You always try to remember and make all my words come true, no matter how small they are. That gives am immense sense of belonging. I can't even bear a single serious look from you.I miss you even when you are in the next room. That’s how deeply you’ve become a part of me.  


From the moment we tied a knot, you became an entire world to me. When I'm with you, I forget everyone else, even my parents. Because in you I find them all. A caring mother, a responsible father , a sharing sibling,  a loyal best friend...When I was pregnant, those midnight hunger pangs and moments of discomfort would have been difficult to bear, but the way you cared for me in those moments made me feel like I had a mother by my side, loving me in a way that words cannot describe.First time when we went to Ongole, I felt something deep—I realized that all the things I had missed experiencing with my father as a child, I found in you.When you guide me, when you sit with me and discuss things, I see a sibling in you. In you, I find everything—love, care, guidance,  companionship,what not.. you became everything to me.. You are my world. when i am excited or  when i am deepressed ,or when i am hurt event though that is because of you ,.. you are my forever single destination,my home. A single warm hug, a gentle touch, a soft whisper from you can fix everything, no matter how broken I feel. 

you showed me what love is . you taught me what living together is. you never give up on me, even when I am at my worst and that is a gift beyond measure.I know that I hurt you soo much... but trust me i will never again make you feel pain because of me. i will give my best efforts to be the girl you wanted and to be the best version of myself for you.

When I see you smiling like an innocent child, when you laugh and create a beautiful chaos around you, my heart fills with joy. I just want to sit there and watch you forever, lost in the magic of your smile. I feel like I could do anything just to see that happiness on your face. And if I am the reason behind that smile, then nothing in this world could make me happier.I know that when you consider someone your own, you love them deeply and do anything for them. And if you ever consider me as your world, I can only imagine how beautifully you would take care of me, how deeply you would love me. I don’t know when that moment will come, but I do know that I am willing to wait for it, no matter how long it takes.  

When I am beside you, with your hand gently holding mine, I don't know why, but I feel an overwhelming sense of pride and courage. It's as though the entire world is at my feet when I'm with you. Just the touch of your hand makes me feel like everything in my life is perfectly fine. When I rest my head on your shoulder, all my worries disappear. In that moment, it feels as though all the burdens I've carried fade away, leaving nothing but peace. The weight of the world seems to disappear when I'm in your arms.

I love you more than words can express, especially when you reach across our bed, pulling me close to you. In those quiet moments, you make me feel like the most cherished person in the world. You make me feel special and loved, and your warmth is something I never want to live without. It's in those moments that I realize how lucky I am to have you in my life. You have this beautiful ability to be silly and carefree with me, making me laugh and feel like everything is light-hearted and full of joy. Your playful nature makes every moment with you unforgettable. And when you carry my heavy bags, it's more than just an act of kindness—it’s your way of showing me how much you care, and it fills my heart with gratitude.

Your love is the reason I find strength, and your presence gives me the courage to face anything that comes my way. Every little thing you do for me, every sweet gesture, speaks volumes about the depth of your love. I want you to know how much I appreciate every moment, every smile, and every word you say to me. You are my everything.


I promise you, from this moment on, nothing will ever come between us. Our bond is something that I hold , and I will always do my best to protect it and cherish it. I will work hard to keep that beautiful smile on your face, and make sure it never fades.

I vow to make our relationship a safe haven, a place where love, support, and peace always exist — even when life feels overwhelming. In the moments when the world feels heavy, know that I will stand by you just as you have stood by me, especially during the hardest times. I want you to always feel that you are never alone, no matter what challenges life brings our way. I will be there beside you, through it all, until the very end.

I promise to walk with you forever, my love. No matter the obstacles or hardships, no matter what we may face, I will be by your side. You are my heart’s home, and nothing will ever change that. I want to continue sharing this beautiful journey with you, hand in hand, and face every tomorrow knowing that we are together.You are my love, my best friend, my partner in everything. I feel so incredibly blessed to have you in my life, and my love for you grows deeper with every passing day. With you, I’ve found my peace, my joy, and my forever. I promise to be there for you in every way, always and forever.


In your arms, I feel safe, loved, and complete. I love you more than words can convey, and I cherish the beautiful life we’re building together. Thank you for being my strength, my joy, and the love of my life. I love you beyond words, beyond time, beyond reason. You are my heart’s home, my greatest love, my forever. I am yours, now and always. You are,and will always be, the love of my life.

**With all my love,**  
*Your forever girl*
